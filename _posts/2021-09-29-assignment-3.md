# To-Do List

## Current week completed tasks:
I created a To-Do app this for this weekâ€™s assignment. 
My application allows for a user to hit a button to add a task to their To-Do List.
The user is able to add as many tasks as they would like, and each task has a check mark next to it that can be toggled on/off pending the task status.

## Planned updates:
I am working on implementing the functionality for the users to be able to update/edit previously added tasks on their To-Do List. 
Currently, when a task is added there is no onClick functionality to get back into the data for updates.
In my next iteration, I will be refactoring my code and likely updating the format of the checklist to allow for this change.
